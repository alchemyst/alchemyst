# Carl Sandrock

## Roles

* Head of Data Science and AI at [proquoai.com](proquoai.com).
* [Extraordinary lecturer](www.up.ac.za/chemeng/csandrock) in the department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Pretoria.

## Interests

I'm interested in process control, optimisation, machine learning, AI, NLP.

## Optimisation
I worked with Schalk Kok on characterising the [roots of the Rosenbrock function](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/evco.2009.17.3.437).

I supervised Stefan Endres, who came up with the [SHGO optimisation algorithm](https://shgo.readthedocs.io), which has been incorporated [in scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.shgo.html).

## Blog

I have a blog called [Negative Feedback](negfeedback.blogspot.com).
